# CrediTrust Complaint Insight Assistant

This project is an internal AI-powered chatbot tool built for **CrediTrust Financial**, designed to help teams quickly understand customer pain points from thousands of unstructured complaint narratives. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this assistant enables product managers, compliance officers, and support teams to ask natural language questions and get concise, context-backed answers.


### Project Goals

-  Reduce time-to-insight from days to minutes
-  Empower non-technical teams to find answers easily
-  Proactively identify and fix issues across products
